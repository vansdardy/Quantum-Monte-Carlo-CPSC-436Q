    "## About this Notebook\n",
    "- In this notebook, we are going to demonstrate how we can use VMC to estimate ground-state energy of a many-body physical system.\n",
    "- For demonstrating the plausibility of this algorithm, while maintaining simplicity, we decide to follow a classic example in showing the effectiveness of VMC, the helium atom.\n",
    "- Without highlighting too much of the physical details which can overshadow the idea of VMC, we will restrict our attention to the electronic degrees of freedom of the helium atom. The nucleus, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, is treated as fixed within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This way, the system can be regarded as consisting 2 interacting electrons in the Coulomb potential of a single immobile nucleus. Introducing the nucleus into the system will drastically complicate this demonstration and shift the focus to physics instead of the method itself, as we need to consider the interaction within the nucleus."

    "## Background Information\n",
    "- Our objective in this demonstration is to determine the electronic ground-state energy of the helium atom.\n",
    "- We will be using a trial wavefunction that is dependent on the Cartesian co-ordinates of the two electrons $\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2$: $$\\Psi_T(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)$$ and we call $\\mathbf{R} = (\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2)$ to be a \"configuration\"\n",
    "- The ground-state energy is approximated by: $$E_0 \\approx \\frac{\\langle \\Psi_T | \\hat{H} | \\Psi_T \\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi_T | \\Psi_T \\rangle}$$\n",
    "- However, the above approximation does not progress naturally, this is where we introduce VMC. We will be sampling according to the trial wavefunction $\\Psi_T$ and obtain a list of configurations $[\\mathbf{R}_1, \\mathbf{R}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{R}_n]$. For each of the configuration, we will calculate its local energy: $$E_{\\text{loc}, i} = \\frac{\\hat{H}\\Psi_T(\\mathbf{R}_i)}{\\Psi_T(\\mathbf{R}_i)}$$ and take the average to approximate $$E_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} E_{\\text{loc}, i}$$\n",
    "- The Hamiltonian, in this helium atom example, $\\hat{H}$, is given to be: $$\\hat{H} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_2^2 - \\frac{2}{r_1} - \\frac{2}{r_2} + \\frac{1}{r_{12}}$$ where this is true in \"atomic units\".\n",
    "- In \"atomic units\" system, we will be \"defining\" the constants of $\\hbar$ (Planck's constant), $m_e$ (mass of an electron), $e$ (the charge of one electron), $4\\pi\\varepsilon_0$ (permittivity) to be $1$. The result of such \"definitions\" is that, length will now be measured in Bohr radii ($a_0$), and energy will now be measured in Hartree ($E_h$)."
