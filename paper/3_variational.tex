As the number of interacting particles in a given system scale, analytically solving the Schr\"odinger's equation of the entire system while incorporating the interaction of particles within becomes intractable.In this case, the Variational Monte Carlo (abbreviated as VMC) method provides a practical approximation to the ground state energy.
