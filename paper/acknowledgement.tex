Tobias would like to thank his past self for making the decision to go on an exchange program to ETH Z\"urich, at which he attended the course of Quantum Physics for Non-physicists taught by Prof. Philipp Kammerlander, and was able to have a foundation in quantum physics, allowing him to understand the various physical concepts present in this paper. Tobias would also like to express his gratefulness to Elisabetta Schneider, whom he met in the aforementioned quantum physics course, because she provided her lecture notes on Computational Quantum Physics for him, giving him a place to start researching.\\

Hannah would like to thank Tobias for taking the time to explain the background physics concepts, which greatly supported her in overcoming gaps in prior knowledge during the development of this paper.
