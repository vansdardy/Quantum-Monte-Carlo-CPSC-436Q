To concisely summarize, this paper discussed three types of QMC methods: VMC, DMC, and PIMC. VMC and DMC generally share the same goal -- approximating the ground-state energy of a many-body system, while PIMC offers a pathway to estimating thermodynamic properties in equilibrium. Both VMC and PIMC relies on the Metropolis algorithm to sample the next configuration, where PIMC's objective of using such an algorithm is to generate a configuration path. Both DMC and PIMC suffer from the fermion sign problem due to the nature of antisymmetry in fermionic systems. This issue can be ``circumvented'' but not solved classically, as it is NP-hard, through imposing certain restricting conditions.
